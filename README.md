Most of us have spent what seemed like forever in a retail store, waiting for the person in front of us in the queue to bill a large number of items, when 
we just needed a loaf of bread or a single shirt. Long lines at the cashier counters can cause  people to wait for a significant amount of time, before they can pay for their products, and leave, regardless of the number of items being purchased.

We propose to do this by using a smart phone application that allows the user to scan the  products he or she wishes to purchase, generate the bill for all the products scanned, make the  payment and simply walk out of the store. This process will ensure easy customer, inventory management and finance handling, making both management and customer happy. This application will help avoid long queues and provide a hassle free checkout.

This Application is made with the use of Andriod Studio farmework.
